    "#### Collaborative filtering methods\n",
    "Collaborative methods for recommender systems are methods that are based solely on the past interactions recorded between users and items in order to produce new recommendations. These interactions are stored in the so-called “user-item interactions matrix”.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea that rules collaborative methods is that these past user-item interactions are sufficient to detect similar users and/or similar items and make predictions based on these estimated proximities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The class of collaborative filtering algorithms is divided into two sub-categories that are generally called memory based and model based approaches. Memory based approaches directly works with values of recorded interactions, assuming no model, and are essentially based on nearest neighbours search (for example, find the closest users from a user of interest and suggest the most popular items among these neighbours). Model based approaches assume an underlying “generative” model that explains the user-item interactions and try to discover it in order to make new predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main advantage of collaborative approaches is that they require no information about users or items and, so, they can be used in many situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is impossible to recommend anything to new users or to recommend a new item to any users and many users or items have too few interactions to be efficiently handled. This drawback can be addressed in different way: recommending random items to new users or new items to random users (random strategy), recommending popular items to new users or new items to most active users (maximum expectation strategy), recommending a set of various items to new users or a new item to a set of various users (exploratory strategy) or, finally, using a non collaborative method for the early life of the user or the item.\n",
    "\n",
    "In memory based collaborative methods, no latent model is assumed. The algorithms directly works with the user-item interactions: for example, users are represented by their interactions with items and a nearest neighbours search on these representations is used to produce suggestions. As no latent model is assumed, these methods have theoretically a low bias but a high variance."

    "a) User-user:\n",
    "In order to make a new recommendation to a user, user-user method roughly tries to identify users with the most similar “interactions profile” (nearest neighbours) in order to suggest items that are the most popular among these neighbours (and that are “new” to our user). This method is said to be “user-centred” as it represent users based on their interactions with items and evaluate distances between users.\n",

    "b) Item-item:\n",
    "To make a new recommendation to a user, the idea of item-item method is to find items similar to the ones the user already “positively” interacted with. Two items are considered to be similar if most of the users that have interacted with both of them did it in a similar way. This method is said to be “item-centred” as it represent items based on interactions users had with them and evaluate distances between those items.\n",
